# Hi there it's Sabry üëã

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm **Sabry**, a passionate **Hardware Verification Engineer** and **IC Design Enthusiast** with a strong passion for **Electronic Design Automation (EDA)**. Below you'll find more about me, my skills, and the exciting projects I‚Äôm working on.

## üë®‚Äçüíª About Me

I‚Äôm a **Junior Engineer** at **Si-Vision** with a strong background in **Digital Verification**, **RTL Design**, and **EDA development**. My expertise spans building and verifying complex digital systems, with a keen interest in the intersection of **EDA**, **AI**, and **VLSI Design**.

One of my major accomplishments is the development of **ART (Automated RTL and Testbench)**, an innovative EDA tool that transforms traditional approaches to RTL design and verification. ART accelerates UVM testbench generation, FSM design, and System Verilog Assertions creation by leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and large language models. The **UVM part of ART** was published as a paper in the **IEEE International Conference on Microelectronics (ICM)**. You can check out the paper [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/12345678) (will be available next month).
