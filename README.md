# Hi there it's Sabry üëã

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm **Sabry**, a passionate **Hardware Verification Engineer** and **IC Design Enthusiast** with a strong passion for **Electronic Design Automation (EDA)**. Below you'll find more about me, my skills, and the exciting projects I‚Äôm working on.

## üë®‚Äçüíª About Me

I‚Äôm a **Junior Engineer** at **Si-Vision** with a strong background in **Digital Verification**, **RTL Design**, and **EDA development**. My expertise spans building and verifying complex digital systems, with a keen interest in the intersection of **EDA**, **AI**, and **VLSI Design**.

I also have a solid background in **software development** and **embedded systems**. Additionally, I have experience in **game development** using **Unity3D** and **C#**, and as a **Flutter developer**.

One of my major accomplishments is the development of **ART (Automated RTL and Testbench)**, an innovative EDA tool that transforms traditional approaches to RTL design and verification. ART accelerates UVM testbench generation, FSM design, and System Verilog Assertions creation by leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and large language models. The **UVM part of ART** was published as a paper in the **IEEE International Conference on Microelectronics (ICM)**. You can check out the paper [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/12345678) (will be available next month).

I was an **Embedded Member** at **Cairo Uni Racing Team**, participating in designing and implementing the entire embedded system in the EV racing vehicle. The following year, I became the **Embedded Communication Sub-team Head**, leading the communication team to build the car's communication system. I also developed a software solution‚Äî**CURT-CUBE**‚Äîto address integration challenges between other sub-teams.

## üöÄ Projects

### **ART Tool (Automated RTL and Testbench)**

ART is an EDA tool that transforms the RTL design and verification process by automating the generation of UVM testbenches, System Verilog Assertions, and FSM designs. Key features include:

- **Schematic Editor & Code Generator**
- **FSM Editor & Code Generator**
- **UVM Configurator & Generator**
- **Text Classification Model for Natural Language Assertions**
- **NLA to SVA Translation**

The tool also includes a custom **PyQt** user interface for easy interaction with these features.

### **RISC-V Processor Development**

Successfully built and verified a **RISC-V processor** and integrated it into a **System-on-Chip (SoC)** environment, verified using **UVM** methodology.
